Do you want to define your own maze?
No problem, it is really easy.

The only thing you need is to remember these characters:
|  # = wall
|  X = destructible wall
|  - = free tile
|  A = spawn position of the agent

Also, the maze must have square/rectangular shape, i.e., all rows must be of same length.
